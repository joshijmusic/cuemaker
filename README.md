auto memory cues for Rekordbox


CueMaker Setup & Usage Guide
Supported Track Type:
CueMaker is designed for tracks with two drops and at least 32 bars before each drop. This applies to over 90% of songs, regardless of BPM.

Before You Start in Rekordbox
Switch to Export Mode.

Set Beat Jump to 8 Bars (on the left side of the player).

Enable Quantise (the red “Q” at the bottom right).

Ensure the BPM and Beat Grid are correct and aligned.

Step 1: Load Your Track
Drag the song into the Rekordbox Export Player.

Step 2: Mark Cue Points (First-Time Setup Only)
You’ll be creating 10 memory cues total, 5 before each drop.

First Drop:

Go to the first drop.

Press C, then M to drop a memory cue.

Press the left arrow, then C, then M – repeat this four times.

You'll now have 5 memory cues: the drop and 4 cues before it.

Second Drop:
4. Go to the second drop.
5. Repeat the same process as above using the left arrow, C, and M.

Step 3: Set Cue Locations in CueMaker
Click Start in CueMaker.

For each of the 10 cue markers (on the right in Rekordbox), press Spacebar one by one from top to bottom to save their positions.

Step 4: Choose Cue Colours
You can customise the colour of each cue (e.g., Purple > Blue > Green > Orange > Red, with Red as the drop).

For each cue:

Right-click the cue marker.

Hover over your desired colour.

Press Spacebar to save that colour location.

Left-click to apply.

Repeat this for all 10 cues (5 before each drop).

Done! Your Template Is Ready.
Marking a New Track
For any new song:

Ensure BPM and grid are correct.

Drop memory cues at:

The first drop (C, M)

The second drop (C, M)

Press Start Automation or F8 in CueMaker.

CueMaker will automatically add all remaining cues and colours based on your template.
